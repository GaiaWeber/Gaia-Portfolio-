			<p>I am a Graphic Designer and Illustrator currently based in Brussels, Belgium. I graduated from the University of the Arts, London in 2017 and since then have had a range of industry experience working as a freelance designer - ranging from commercial design to brand development and environmental design. <br><br>

My style of work takes inspiration from my international background and particularly my roots in South East Asia. Although I specialize and have a strong focus on illustration, I am a well-rounded multidisciplinary designer with an affinity for all things design. I am instinctively pulled to creative challenges and am continuously searching for ways to expand and evolve my practice - whilst still keeping true to my distinctive style.
